2. Create README.md
# echo "laravel-quickstart-config" >> README.md

3. Commit and push README.md into master branch

5. Copy folder config from 09_Deployment_Config/internal to laravel-quickstart-config/config using command line
# cp -r internal/config <your-laravel-quickstart-config-project-path>

6. Make sure that you have directory "config" at root directory of your git.

10. Copy folder config from 09_Deployment_Config/production to laravel-quickstart-config/config
# cp -r production/config <your-laravel-quickstart-config-project-path>
