Workshop 12 : Create your deployment dockers

1. Create new git repositories "laravel-quickstart-dockers" and checkout to your projects directory

2. Create README.md
# echo "laravel-quickstart-dockers" >> README.md

3. Commit and push README.md into master branch

4. Create branch "internal" and checkout "internal"

5. Copy folder dockers from 12_Git_Deploy_Dockers/internal to laravel-quickstart-dockers/dockers using command line
# cp -r internal/dockers <your-laravel-quickstart-dockers-project-path>

6. Be sure that "dockers" is in the root path of your git.
** We warn you because if you do not have "dockers" directory at root of your git, you will fail in the next few workshop.

7. Commit and push internal branch

9. Then create production branch from master branch and checkout

10. Copy folder dockers from 12_Git_Deploy_Dockers/production to laravel-quickstart-dockers/dockers
