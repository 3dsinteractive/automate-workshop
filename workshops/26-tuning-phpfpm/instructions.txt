Workshop 26 : Tuning PHP-FPM for production

:: Deployment Docker Production ::

Config file > automate-workshop/workshops/14-deployment-dockers/production/dockers/php-fpm/conf/php-fpm.d/www.conf

```
pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 200
pm.start_servers = 100
pm.min_spare_servers = 50
pm.max_spare_servers = 150
```

# Adjust pm.max_children
> The number of child processes to be created when pm is set to static and the maximum number of child processes to be created when pm is set to dynamic. This option is mandatory.

```
pm.max_children = RAM / Memory per child process size
```

Show php-fpm Memory use
```
ps -ylC php-fpm --sort:rss
```

Show average memory use per process
```
ps ax --no-headers -o "rss,cmd" -C php-fpm | awk '{ sum+=$1 } END { printf ("%d%s\n", sum/NR/1024,"M") }'
```

Example:
- RAM 16GB
- Memory per process = 64MB

MAX_CHILDREN  = (16 * 1024) / 64MB
              = 256

Or

MAX_CHILDREN  = ((16 - 2) * 1024) / 64MB
              = 224

p.s 2GB for other process

# Adjuest pm.start_servers
> The number of child processes created on startup. Used only when pm is set to dynamic. Default Value: min_spare_servers + (max_spare_servers - min_spare_servers) / 2

Example:
- MIN_SPARE = 100
- MAX_SPARE = 150

START_SERVER  = 100 + (150 - 100) / 2
              = 125

# Adjust pm.min_spare_servers
> The desired minimum number of idle server processes. Used only when pm is set to dynamic. Also mandatory in this case.

# Adjust pm.max_spare_servers
> The desired maximum number of idle server processes. Used only when pm is set to dynamic. Also mandatory in this case.
